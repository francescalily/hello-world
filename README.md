# hello-world
My first repository for La Fosse Academy pre-work

### My name is Franki and this is my first github repository.
**I'm playing around with the markdown syntax as provided in the github documents**

The three main things I am interested in is:
1. Generative Art
2. Artificial Intelligence 
3. Interactive websites

*I am very happy to be participating with La Fosse Academy*
